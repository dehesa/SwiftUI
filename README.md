This repo contains code with examples on how to use Apple's SwiftUI. Some sample code has been created by [me](https://github.com/dehesa), while others have been picked from Github. The latter ones are in this repo because they have been heavily modified, not only to support the latest version of Swift, but also to add support to iOS and macOS (when applicable). Links to the source Github repos or websites are provided.

## Projects

-   [SwiftUI Labs](https://swiftui-lab.com) projects.<br>
    SwiftUI Labs is a fantastic website discussing advance features. Its author ([Javier](https://twitter.com/SwiftUILab)) has also released a [companion-educational app](https://swiftui-lab.com/companion/) that is worth every penny.
    -   [View preferences (regular)](https://swiftui-lab.com/communicating-with-the-view-tree-part-1) discuss what SwiftUI view preferences are and how to use them.
    -   [View preferences (anchored)](https://swiftui-lab.com/communicating-with-the-view-tree-part-2) discuss what the _anchor preferences_ are and how to use them.
    -   [View preferences (nested views)](https://swiftui-lab.com/communicating-with-the-view-tree-part-3) provides an example of a complex view using view preferences.
    -   [ScrollView (pull to refresh)](https://swiftui-lab.com/scrollview-pull-to-refresh) provides an implementation of pull-to-refresh not yet included in standard SwiftUI.
    -   [Alignment (hello world)](https://swiftui-lab.com/alignment-guides) introduces alignment guides.
    -   [Alignment (musketeers)](https://swiftui-lab.com/alignment-guides) visualizes how alignment guides are _ignored_ by its container parent.
    -   [Alignment (tool)](https://swiftui-lab.com/alignment-guides) lets you play with alignment guides.<br>
        This is a fantastic tool and [Javier](https://twitter.com/SwiftUILab) deserves huge props for making this open source and discover undocumented functionality. Hats off to you, sir!
    -   [Frame (little squares)](https://swiftui-lab.com/frame-behaviors) reviews the `frame()` and `fixedSize()` modifiers.
    -   [Styling (triple toggle)](https://swiftui-lab.com/custom-styling) provides example on how to use and create custom control styles.
    -   [State (arrow)](https://swiftui-lab.com/state-changes) discuss the perils of mutating state within a SwiftUI view body and the CPU usage. 
- [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) projects.<br>
  [Paul](https://twitter.com/twostraws) is one of the best Swift teachers/educators out there. Through his website and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJi5RdDLgzvkl3Ly0DRMlQ) he offers a very comprehensive path to learn any Apple related technology.
    -   [Starter project](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/swiftui-tutorial-building-a-complete-project) builds a comple SwiftUI project.
