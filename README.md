This repo contains code with examples on how to use Apple's SwiftUI. Some sample code has been created by [me](https://github.com/dehesa), while others have been picked from Github. The latter ones are in this repo because they have been heavily modified, not only to support the latest version of Swift, but also to add support to iOS and macOS (when applicable). Links to the source Github repos or websites are provided.

## Projects

-   [SwiftUI Labs](https://swiftui-lab.com) projects.

    SwiftUI Labs is a fantastic website discussing advance features. Its author ([Javier](https://twitter.com/SwiftUILab)) has also released a [companion-educational app](https://swiftui-lab.com/companion/) that is worth every penny.

    -   [View preferences (regular)](https://swiftui-lab.com/communicating-with-the-view-tree-part-1) discuss what SwiftUI view preferences are and how to use them.
    -   [View preferences (anchored)](https://swiftui-lab.com/communicating-with-the-view-tree-part-2) discuss what the _anchor preferences_ are and how to use them.
    -   [View preferences (nested views)](https://swiftui-lab.com/communicating-with-the-view-tree-part-3) provides an example of a complex view using view preferences.
